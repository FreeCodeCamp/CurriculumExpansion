## To Do

1. Break project down into more granular steps
  - Have user write more of the HTML and CSS (and move all styles to single style.css file)
  - More detailed review here: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/pull/136

2. Consider refactoring the project
  - Make project mobile friendly
  - Teach other CSS grid concepts like `grid-column: 1 / span 7`
  - Here are examples of what that might look like:
