/* 
For typography, you could set it on the html and body element. First, lets target the `html` element and set its `font-size` to `62.5%`.
Why we set it to this value? Because we will want to use the flexible unit `rem` within the rest of our CSS rule. The default font-size is 16px, so by set it to 62.5%, our default font-size will become 62.5% * 16px = 10px.
So by typing `2rem`, it is equal to `20px`. This is will make easier for us to calculate our CSS unit.
