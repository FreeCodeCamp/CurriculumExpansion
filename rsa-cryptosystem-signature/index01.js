Cryptography is the science of protecting information from an unauthorized access. 

Digital signature is a way to verify the authenticity and integrity of documents and messages.

First, we need to hash our message, which is a method to transform a document into a fixed-size value.

Create a hash function `hashTheMessage()` with `message` as a parameter.
