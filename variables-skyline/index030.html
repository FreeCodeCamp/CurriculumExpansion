<!--
  Add a border to everything by using the `*` selector in your style area and giving it a `border` of `1px solid black`. This is a trick I like to use to help visualize where elements are and their size. You will remove this later. Also add a `box-sizing` of `border-box` to the `*` selector. This will make it so the border doesn't add any size to your elements.
