/*
Notice that the returned amount of appliyDiscount function has a lot of numbers after the decimal.

This is very common pheonomenon when working arthimatic operations with float numbers in JavaScript.

There is in-built method called toFixed that can help us. 

The method takes in a parameter which you can specify the number of decimal points. It will round up the number as well.

Let's attach toFixed() to the returned discount amount. Pass in 2.

This will convert the number type to string.
