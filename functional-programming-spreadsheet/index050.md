## Description
<section id='description'>
This is possible because the anonymous function has been immediately assigned to a value - this is effectively the same as using a named function.
Rewrite the above using ES6's arrow syntax:
```
const fn = (x, y) => x;
```
Note that the value is returned implicitly.
