## Description
<section id='description'>
In functional programming, we prefer immutable values over mutable values.
Mutable values (declared with `var` or `let`) can lead to unexpected behaviors and bugs.
Values declared with `const` cannot be reassigned, which makes using them easier because you don't have to keep track of their values.
Start by creating an empty `infixToFunction` object using `const`.
