<!-- 
    To distiguish between both divs and to help us
    style each div indivually, we need to use  CSS selectors.
    
    Give the first div an `id` selector with the value of `piano`.
    Give the second div a `class` selector with the value of `keys`.
    
    The code should look like so:

    ```
    <div id="piano">
        <div class="keys"></div>
    </div>
    ```
