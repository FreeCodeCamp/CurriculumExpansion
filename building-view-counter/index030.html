    Now we can see the text in our web page but we haven't populated the count yet.

    Now to get the count, we will be sending an ajax request to the server in our
    javascript code and it will take a moment to receive the response. Till we get
    the response, we will not able to show the count, so, in this moment
    we can hide the text when the web page loads, and when we get the view
    count from server we can show the text along with the count

    To hide the text when the web page loads, wrap it around a <span> tag,
    give it an id "message". Use css property "display" to hide the <span>

    <h1>What's Ajax?</h1>
    <p class="article">
        AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. In a nutshell, it is the use of the XMLHttpRequest object to
        communicate with servers. It can send and receive information in various formats, including JSON, XML, HTML
        and text files. AJAXâ€™s most appealing characteristic is its "asynchronous" nature, which means it can
        communicate with the server, exchange data, and update the page without having to refresh the page. <br> <br>

        The two major features of AJAX allow you to do the following: <br> <br>

        1. Make requests to the server without reloading the page <br>
        2. Receive and work with data from the server <br> <br>
