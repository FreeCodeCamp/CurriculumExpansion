    Now we see that the span tag is not displayed.

    Next, when we display the view count, we will need to access the <span>
    tag from js code to modify it to show the count along with the text. 
    With the current code, we will have to get the whole text in the <span>
    tag and then append it with the count, instead it would be easier if we
    can just populate a field straight away
    
    To do this add another <span> tag inside the <span> tag and give it an
    id "viewCount"

    <h1>What's Ajax?</h1>
    <p class="article">
        AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. In a nutshell, it is the use of the XMLHttpRequest object to
        communicate with servers. It can send and receive information in various formats, including JSON, XML, HTML
        and text files. AJAXâ€™s most appealing characteristic is its "asynchronous" nature, which means it can
        communicate with the server, exchange data, and update the page without having to refresh the page. <br> <br>

        The two major features of AJAX allow you to do the following: <br> <br>

        1. Make requests to the server without reloading the page <br>
        2. Receive and work with data from the server <br> <br>
